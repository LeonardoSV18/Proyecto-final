<h1> Origin and creation </h1>

<p> The Batman Who Laughs is an alternate version of Bruce Wayne from Earth-22. In this version, Bruce Wayne is pushed to the brink when he is 
    forced to kill the Joker, his greatest enemy, in self-defense. 
    <br>
    However, after killing the Joker, he is exposed to a toxin from the Joker's 
    body that transforms him. This toxin causes him to gain the Joker's insanity while also retaining his brilliant mind and physical prowess as Batman.
   <br>
    This version of Batman is driven by a new, horrific purpose: a twisted combination of his detective skills and Joker-like chaos. 
    
    <br>He becomes a dark reflection of the hero he once was, twisted by the same motivations and methods he once fought against. As a result, he gains an unpredictable 
    and sadistic nature, with a deep love for violence and psychological manipulation.
