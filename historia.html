<h1>Powers and Abilities:</h1>

 <p>

   
    1. Batman's Physical Abilities: He has the strength, agility, and intelligence of the regular Batman, along with advanced combat training, detective skills, and strategic genius.
    <br>
    2. Joker's Insanity and Tactics: His mind is infused with the Joker's chaotic and anarchic mindset. He revels in causing suffering and is a master manipulator, unpredictable and dangerous in ways even the Joker himself wasn't.
    <br>
    3.Spiked Helmets and Weapons: He wears a spiked helmet, which reflects his sinister appearance. He also has a variety of dangerous weapons at his disposal, often designed with a twisted sense of humor, mirroring the Joker's design philosophy.
    <br>
    4.Demonic Powers: After his transformation, he gains access to supernatural abilities linked to his connection with the Dark Multiverse. These include a sort of "toxic" influence, where his mind can manipulate and twist the perceptions of others, turning allies into pawns or enemies into chaotic weapons.

<h1> Character Traits </h1>

<p> 
     - Sadism and Intellect: Despite being emotionally warped by the Joker's insanity, he remains a calculating and intelligent strategist. He combines Batman's disciplined mind with the Joker's unpredictable nature, making him a terrifying adversary.
    <br>     
     - Lack of Morality: The Batman Who Laughs operates without any moral compass. He is willing to sacrifice anyone and anything to achieve his goals, often with a penchant for cruelty.
    <br>    
     - Vision of Justice: Like the Joker, he does not believe in traditional justice. Instead, he views the world as a game and himself as the ultimate player. He sees the insanity of Gotham and the world as a reflection of truth.
